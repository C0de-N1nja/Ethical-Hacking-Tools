# ⌨️ Keylogger — Ethical Hacking Toolkit Component

A Python-based keylogger designed to demonstrate real-world keystroke logging techniques for **educational and ethical hacking purposes only**.

This module is part of the [`C0de-N1nja-Ethical-Hacking-Tools`](../../README.md) project — a hands-on offensive security learning toolkit.

## 🧠 What is a Keylogger?

A keylogger (short for *keystroke logger*) captures keyboard input from a target system. It is commonly used in red teaming, threat simulation, and malware analysis.

> Ethical hackers study keyloggers to understand how attackers steal credentials, monitor user behavior, and evade detection — all while building defenses to stop them.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

This keylogger module helps learners and professionals:

- Understand how real-world keystroke logging works
- Analyze input capture and user surveillance tactics
- Build detection techniques and secure system configurations
- Strengthen ethical hacking knowledge via simulation

> ✅ All examples are safe, local, and fully open source for experimentation.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- 🐍 Python 3.6+
- 📦 [`pynput`](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) for keyboard capture

Install it using:

```bash
pip install pynput
````

> Some advanced versions also require `pyperclip`, `psutil`, or `pywin32`.
