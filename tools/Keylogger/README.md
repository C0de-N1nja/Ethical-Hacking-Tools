# 🎯 Keylogger — Ethical Hacking Toolkit Component

A keylogger is a surveillance tool designed to record every keystroke made on a target system. This component of the `C0de-N1nja-Ethical-Hacking-Tools` project is built to demonstrate the real-world functioning of keyloggers for **educational and ethical hacking purposes only**.

## 🧠 What is a Keylogger?

A keylogger (short for *keystroke logger*) is a program that captures user input from the keyboard. It is widely studied in cybersecurity to understand how attackers harvest sensitive information such as passwords, personal messages, or credentials without user awareness.

> In red teaming and security research, keyloggers help simulate attacker techniques so defenders can detect, analyze, and prevent such threats.

## 🔐 Why This Project Matters

This project aims to:

- Teach students how keyloggers work at a code level  
- Demonstrate how attackers may exploit keyboard input for data theft  
- Encourage secure coding and endpoint defense practices  
- Promote ethical hacking through hands-on experience  

It is intended for learners, researchers, red teamers, and educators working within legal and authorized environments.
