# üõ†Ô∏è Ethical Hacking Tools

This directory contains a collection of custom-built tools developed for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and cybersecurity research. These tools are written primarily in Python and are intended to help understand attack vectors, improve defense strategies, and build real-world offensive security skills.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Legal Notice:** These tools are provided strictly for **educational purposes** and authorized testing. Do **not** use them on systems or networks without proper legal consent. Unauthorized use is illegal and punishable under cybercrime laws.

## üéØ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Provide practical tools for ethical hackers and red teamers.
- Offer a learning ground for students and security professionals.
- Demonstrate real-world attack techniques in a controlled and legal environment.

Each tool focuses on a specific concept or technique commonly encountered in offensive security, such as:
- Remote access (reverse shells)
- Reconnaissance and scanning
- Credential harvesting
- File system interaction
- Command execution and persistence
- Network manipulation

## üß† How to Use

Each tool is self-contained in its own subdirectory and includes a dedicated `README.md` explaining:
- What the tool does
- Technical workings
- How to set it up and run it
- Common use cases
- Any limitations or caveats

Before using any tool:
1. Ensure you have the proper environment (e.g., Python version, required packages).
2. Update IP addresses, ports, or configurations as needed.
3. Run in a controlled lab or authorized testing environment.
